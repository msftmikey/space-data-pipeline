# Space Data

This project is focused on analyzing asteroid data to better understand their size, speed, and whether they pose any potential risk. 
The goal is to learn how to manipulate and visualize data using Python. 
The dataset is sourced from NASA's public API and includes information about asteroids, such as their distance from Earth, size, and velocity. 
As part of the project, we'll be using Python libraries like Pandas for data analysis and Matplotlib for visualizations.
